Jeu-de-nim
==========

This project was made during my last year of my bachelor. It's a game which is played with two players. 
We have a gameboard with 9 matches on it. The matches are placed in 3 lines forming a pyramid.
Players have to take out 1,2 or 3 matches from the gameboard each turn. The player who take out the last match has lost the game.

The game is coded in C# using a XAML interface. There is an AI written in C++ which is based on the MinMax algorithm.
It's a good example and different from classics examples that can be found on internet.
